## AI-Specific Considerations

### Transparency Requirements
```
AI DISCLOSURE

This conversation uses artificial intelligence to:
- Understand your responses
- Identify business patterns
- Generate recommendations
- Create customized proposals

The AI does not:
- Make final decisions
- Share data with other clients
- Learn from your specific data without consent
- Replace human judgment

Human oversight is maintained throughout the process.
```

### Model Data Usage
- **Training**: Only on anonymized, aggregated data
- **Client Consent**: Explicit opt-in for improvement
- **Segregation**: Client data never in base models
- **Right to Object**: Can opt-out while maintaining service

## International Considerations

### Data Transfers
- **EU → US**: Standard Contractual Clauses
- **UK**: UK GDPR compliance  
- **Canada**: PIPEDA compliance
- **Localization**: Store data in client's region when required

This framework ensures Business Doctor maintains the highest standards of data protection while enabling innovative AI-powered services.

## Email 1: For Law Firm Contact

**Subject: Transforming Legal Intake with AI - 90% Less Time, 30% More Clients**

Hi [Name],

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to reach out because I've moved on from Modern IT and launched something that could be game-changing for [Law Firm Name].

I'm now running Business Doctor, where we're essentially "BCG for SMBs" - we do strategic AI transformation for professional services firms on the Microsoft stack. Think beyond basic IT support to actually transforming how firms operate.

Quick example: We just built an AI system that handles client intake 24/7, does conflict checks instantly, and books consultations automatically. One firm saw 30% more consultations booked and saved 20 hours/week on intake.

I know [Law Firm Name] has been growing rapidly. Would you be interested in a 15-minute call to see if our Legal Client Intake Automator could help? As a former Modern IT client, I'd offer a 20% pilot discount.

We're not competing with Modern IT - they're great at infrastructure. We're focused purely on AI transformation that drives revenue and efficiency.

Available for a quick call this week?

Best,
Mike Simka

P.S. Here's a 2-minute video showing the intake system in action: [Link]

## Email 2: For Non-Profit Contact

**Subject: From Modern IT to AI Transformation - Multiplying Your Impact**

Hi [Name],

I've been thinking about [Non-Profit Name] since leaving Modern IT to start Business Doctor. We're doing something completely different - using AI to help organizations like yours multiply their impact without multiplying overhead.

Here's what I mean: Instead of just managing your Microsoft 365 (which Modern IT does well), we're deploying AI to automate grant writing, donor communications, and program reporting. One non-profit freed up 30 hours/week for actual program delivery.

I remember you mentioning how much time your team spends on administrative work instead of your mission. What if AI could handle 80% of that?

Since we worked together at Modern IT, I'd love to offer [Non-Profit Name] our pilot program rate - essentially our cost to prove the model.

Could we grab 20 minutes this week? I can show you exactly how organizations like yours are using AI to do more with less.

Best regards,
Mike Simka

## Email 3: For Professional Services Contact

**Subject: Quick Question - Still Drowning in Manual Processes?**

[Name],

Mike Simka here (formerly with Modern IT). Quick question: Is [Company Name] still handling [specific process they complained about] manually?

I ask because I've pivoted to something that directly addresses this. Business Doctor is like having BCG consultants rebuild your operations with AI, but at MSP prices.

Real example: A 45-person firm like yours was spending 40 hours/week on document processing. We deployed AI that cut it to 4 hours. Same quality, 10x speed.

The difference from my Modern IT days? We're not fixing computers - we're transforming businesses. And we guarantee measurable ROI every quarter.

I'd love to run our free AI diagnostic tool on your Microsoft 365 environment. It identifies your top 3 automation opportunities with specific ROI projections. Takes 30 minutes.

Interested? As a Modern IT connection, you'd get preferred pricing on any transformation work.

Let's turn [Company Name] into the AI-powered leader in your space.

Cheers,
Mike

**Subject: Re: [Original Subject] - Quick Video**

[Name],

I know you're busy, so I recorded a 90-second video showing what I meant about AI transformation: [Personalized Loom Link]

It shows how a firm exactly like [Company Name] automated [specific pain point] and the exact ROI they achieved.

If it's not relevant, no worries - just thought of you because of our Modern IT connection.

If you're curious, I'm holding 3 pilot spots for December at 50% off our normal transformation fee.

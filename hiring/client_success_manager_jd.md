## Our Ideal Candidate

You're the person clients call first when they need advice. You get genuinely excited when clients succeed. You see technology as a tool to solve business problems, not an end in itself. You can context-switch between a law firm partner and a non-profit director, speaking each one's language fluently.

Most importantly, you believe in our mission: democratizing enterprise-level AI capabilities for SMBs.

## Interview Process

2. **Case Study** (Take-home) - Review client scenario and propose success plan
3. **Panel Interview** (90 min) - Deep dive on experience and approach

3. LinkedIn profile URL
4. Optional: Any client success metrics you're proud of

Use subject line: "CSM - [Your Name] - Ready to Transform SMBs"

## A Note from Our Founder

"I'm looking for someone who gets as excited as I do when a law firm partner says 'I got home in time for dinner with my kids for the first time in months.' This role is about changing lives through AI transformation. If that sounds like your kind of challenge, let's talk."

- Mike Simka, Founder & CEO
